# Contributing

As of right now, I'm currently not accepting any pull requests.

Once I'm a little more confident in my GIT skills, I might consider it.

In my mind, a clean repo should embody the following:

- [ ] Repository would need to be PUBLIC
- [ ] All private credentials should not exist in the source
- [ ] Commits should be clean and exclusive to the files that were changed
- [ ] Generate a pull request for every change.  No excuses
- [ ] Commit to a branch...  Don't just commit directly to Master
